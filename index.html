        With Halloween drawing near,
        everyone is in the mood to seek out fear.
        To celebrate the creepiness of this holiday,
        here is a little poem to bring some eerieness to your day.
    </div>
    
    <div>
        Sitting alone in your dorm room with a thunderstorm brewing outside,
        Your roommate is gone for the night and there is no one by your side.
        Completely out of nowhere the power goes out,
        You claim that it is caused by the storm but at the back of your mind there is doubt.
    </div>

    <div>
        You notice the lights in the hallway are still on,
        and it sounds like the rest of the residents have all gone.
        You try to go out and look in the hallway,
        but the door is locked from the outside keeping you at bay.
    </div>

    <div>
        Suddenly you hear a crash behind you,
        "How strong is this storm, how much damage can it do?"
        You turn around to see a shadow with a menacing stare,
        No specific features with it's body so bare.
    </div>

    <div>
        You try to scream, your body full of fright,
        But nothing escapes despite your might. 
        The shadow approaches ever so near,
        but you can't even move, you're shaking from fear.
    </div>
    
    <div>
        Suddenly you can't see or feel a thing
        Everything from your mind and body is outside a state of being.
        You don't know what happened and you don't know if you were killed,
        But all you do know is that everything is perfectly still. 
    </div>
